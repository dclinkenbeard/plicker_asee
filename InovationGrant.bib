However, it has drawn fire from a number of critics, the most famous criticism being that of Kenneth MacCorquodale's 1970 paper On Chomsky's Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior. MacCorquodale argued that Chomsky did not possess an adequate understanding of either behavioral psychology in general, or the differences between Skinner's behaviorism and other varieties. As a consequence, he argued, Chomsky made several serious errors of logic. On account of these problems, MacCorquodale maintains that the review failed to demonstrate what it has often been cited as doing, implying that those most influenced by Chomsky's paper probably already substantially agreed with him. Chomsky's review has been further argued to misrepresent the work of Skinner and others, including by taking quotes out of context. Chomsky has maintained that the review was directed at the way Skinner's variant of behavioral psychology "was being used in Quinean empiricism and naturalization of philosophy. Chomsky's influence was a point that Skinner himself conceded. Sam Leigland suggests that interest in Skinner's work is growing with the next focus on a variety of complex verbal phenomena."},

During CUREnet meetings and discussions, it became apparent that there is need for a clear definition of what constitutes a CURE and systematic exploration of what makes CUREs meaningful in terms of student learning. Thus, we assembled a small working group of people with expertise in CURE instruction and assessment to: 1) draft an operational definition of a CURE, with the aim of defining what makes a laboratory course or project a ``research experience''; 2) summarize research on CUREs, as well as findings from studies of undergraduate research internships that would be useful for thinking about how students are influenced by participating in CUREs; and 3) identify areas of greatest need with respect to CURE assessment, and directions for future research on and evaluation of CUREs. This report summarizes the outcomes and recommendations of this meeting.},

In most experiments a bolus injection of the isotope into the left coronary artery was followed by a difference in activity between areas supplied by the left anterior descending and left circumflex branches. This indicated inadequate mixing of blood and isotope in the main stem of the artery. The uneven distribution did not result in differences between the epi- and endocardial activity concentrations. The results from one normal, anesthetized dog in which tissue activities were measured after constant rate infusion of Xe-133 into the left coronary artery for 8 min were in accordance with the general assumption of equal epi- and endocardial volumes of distribution (values of lambda).},

While national calls to improve science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education have led to an increase in research revealing the positive effects of CUREs for science majors, less work has specifically examined whether nonmajors are impacted in the same way. To address this gap in our understanding, a working group focused on nonmajors CUREs was convened to discuss the following questions: 1) What are our laboratory-learning goals for nonmajors? 2) What are our research priorities to determine best practices for nonmajors CUREs? 3) How can we collaborate to define and disseminate best practices for nonmajors in CUREs? We defined three broad student outcomes of prime importance to the nonmajors CURE: improvement of scientific literacy skills, proscience attitudes, and evidence-based decision making. We evaluated the state of knowledge of best practices for nonmajors, and identified research priorities for the future. The report that follows is a summary of the conclusions and future directions from our discussion.},

Unless people believe they can produce desired effects by their actions, they have little incentive to undertake activities or to persevere in the face of difficulties. Whatever other factors may serve as guides and motivators, they are rooted in the core belief that one can make a difference by one's actions.},

  abstract = {Presents an integrative theoretical framework to explain and to predict psychological changes achieved by different modes of treatment. This theory states that psychological procedures, whatever their form, alter the level and strength of self-efficacy. It is hypothesized that expectations of personal efficacy determine whether coping behavior will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences. Persistence in activities that are subjectively threatening but in fact relatively safe produces, through experiences of mastery, further enhancement of self-efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive behavior. In the proposed model, expectations of personal efficacy are derived from 4 principal sources of information: performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. Factors influencing the cognitive processing of efficacy information arise from enactive, vicarious, exhortative, and emotive sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation. Findings are reported from microanalyses of enactive, vicarious, and emotive modes of treatment that support the hypothesized relationship between perceived self-efficacy and behavioral changes.

In our two-pronged approach, students in integrative final-year capstone courses and summer research experiences develop games to teach computer science, which, in turn, will be used to improve introductory computing courses. Our successful model for summer undergraduate research and capstone projects engages students in solving the computing retention problem, allows them to quickly create games, and instructs students in user- and learner-centered design and research methods. Results show that this method of building games to teach engages students at multiple levels, inspiring newer students that one day their homework may all be games, and encouraging advanced students to continue on into graduate studies in computing.},

Both constructs share many similarities such as centrality of perceived competence in construct definition; use of mastery experience, social comparison, and reflected appraisals as major information sources; and a domain-specific and multidimensional nature. Both predict motivation, emotion, and performance to varying degrees. However, there are also important differences. These differences include integration vs. separation of cognition and affect, heavily normative vs. goal-referenced evaluation of competence, aggregated vs. context-specific judgment, hierarchical vs. loosely hierarchical structure, past vs. future orientation, and relative temporal stability vs. malleability. We argue that self-efficacy acts as an active precursor of self-concept development and suggest that self-concept research separate out its multiple components and subprocesses and invest more effort toward making students less preoccupied with normative ability comparisons in school.},

  abstract = {Most research on the digital divide has focused on its socio-demographic correlates. Results indicate that age, gender and education, in particular, are major factors structuring the digital divide. So pervasive is the presence of age differences in the literature that many observers believe that the digital divide is basically a generational phenomenon that, in time, will disappear as younger computer literate cohorts replace older non-users. However, some researchers call this assumption into question. Moreover, the dominant focus on socio-demographics has led to a relative neglect of psychological factors as possible explanations for differential adoption and use of ICT. Consequently, the present study employs the social cognitive and self-efficacy theories of Bandura (1986, 1997) and the locus of control construct of Rotter (1966) in order to investigate some psychological correlates of the digital divide among a representative sample of Flemish adolescents (n = 1145). The results indicate that computer locus of control and ICT self-efficacy supplement socio-demographic explanations of the digital divide. The results, however, are gender specific, indicating that there are different processes operating for males and females.},

Using scripts to divide the children's commands typed into categories, we found that girls spend significantly more time than boys communicating with others in the CSCL environment. Analyzing the children's level of programming achievement, we found that gender does not affect programming performance. Regression analysis shows that performance is correlated with prior programming experience and time on task. Boys are more likely than girls to have prior programming experience, and spend more time programming on average. We contrast these quantitative findings with our qualitative observations, and conclude that quantitative analysis has an important role to play in CSCL research. These results suggest that educators wishing to increase gender equity in technical skill should focus on strategies for fostering interest among girls.},

This study, which is the first to assess broadly the causes of the growing female advantage in college completion, considers the impact of family resources as well as gender differences in academic performance and in the pathways to college completion on the rising gender gap. Analyses of General Social Survey data indicate that the female-favorable trend in college completion emerged unevenly by family status of origin to the disadvantage of sons in families with a low-educated or absent father. Additional analyses of National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS) data indicate that women's superior academic performance plays a large role in producing the gender gap in college completion, but that this effect remains latent until after the transition to college. For NELS cohorts, who were born in the mid-1970s, the female advantage in college completion remains largest in families with a low-educated or absent father, but currently extends to all family types. In conjunction with women's growing incentives to attain higher education, gender differences in resources related to family background and academic performance largely explain the growing female advantage in college completion.},

Many educational institutions offer Internet-based on-line courses in an effort to meet the educational needs of students. The primary goal of this research was to determine if there is a relationship between students' preferred learning environment (i.e. face-to-face or on-line) and their learning style. The secondary goal was to determine if there were any differences in the academic success of students in the face-to-face versus on-line sections. Participants were adult (ages 22+ years), non-traditional computer science students given the option to take a face-to-face lecture-based or an on-line Internet-based computer science course. Results revealed that computer science students in the face-to-face learning environment were more likely to have the Assimilator learning-style, whereas computer science students in the on-line Internet-based learning environment were more likely to have the Converger learning-style. Student academic success did not reliably differ as a function of learning environment selection. Implications of these results are discussed in terms of learning style characteristics of computer science students, learning styles and gender differences and implications of student academic success in on-line vs face-to-face environments.},

  abstract = {The recession that began in December of 2007 is already 30 months old, but the U.S. economy will not recover its pre-recession employment levels for at least another two years. From there, it will take an additional three years to make up for lost growth and create a job market strong enough to employ both the casualties of the recession and the millions of new workers who will stream into the workforce from schools across the country. In this report, the authors look at the current state of the economy, assess the prospects for job creation through 2018, and detail what employers will be looking for once hiring resumes. Among other things, they find that: (1) There is a growing mismatch between the jobs that will be created over the next decade and the education and training of our adult workers. More than 60 million of our prime-age workforce who are 25-54 years old are still working in jobs that require high school or less; (2) The postsecondary education and training system will fall short by 3 million or more postsecondary degrees. Economic demand will not be met, denying numerous Americans access to middle-class career pathways; (3) Hundreds of thousands of Manufacturing and Natural Resources jobs in farming, fishing, and forestry have been destroyed in the recession and will not be coming back; (4) The U.S. economy will create 46.8 million job openings by 2018, including 13.8 newly created jobs and 33 million "replacement" positions produced when workers retire; (5) Employers filling these jobs, overwhelmingly, will require college degrees or other postsecondary preparation of 63 percent of their new hires; (6) Postsecondary education and training is quickly becoming the only viable path to the American middle class; and (7) Education and training connects directly to occupations and less directly to industries, which can complicate economic development efforts.

  abstract = {Producing sufficient numbers of graduates who are prepared for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) occupations has become a national priority in the United States. To attain this goal, some policymakers have targeted reducing STEM attrition in college, arguing that retaining more students in STEM fields in college is a low-cost, fast way to produce the STEM professionals that the nation needs (President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology [PCAST] 2012). Within this context, this Statistical Analysis Report (SAR) presents an examination of students' attrition from STEM fields over the course of 6 years in college using data from the 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/09) and the associated 2009 Postsecondary Education Transcript Study (PETS:09). In this SAR, the term STEM attrition refers to enrollment choices that result in potential STEM graduates (i.e., undergraduates who declare a STEM major) moving away from STEM fields by switching majors to non-STEM fields or leaving postsecondary education before earning a degree or certificate. The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of this attrition by: (1) determining rates of attrition from STEM and non-STEM fields; (2) identifying characteristics of students who leave STEM fields; (3) comparing the STEM coursetaking and performance of STEM leavers and persisters; and (4) examining the strength of various factors' associations with STEM attrition. Appended are: (1) Glossary; (2) Technical Notes and Methodology; (3) Classification of Major Field of Study in BPS:04/09; and (4) Classification of Postsecondary STEM Courses in BPS:04/09.

Our message, based on previous scientific studies, is in the form of short movie emphasizing that exercising during 2\% of the day, or 30 min, is sufficient to remain in good health. The slogan, ``What's Your 2\%?'' is appealing because ``2\%'' is perceived as such a tiny fraction, yet it accurately reflects the 30-minute daily exercise goal as recommended by experts. This study uses persuasive techniques applied to a group of subjects composed of members of our personal Facebook networks, and this social network platform as way to communicate with them. We were able to demonstrate that changing a person's short-term exercise behavior is possible by using persuasive technology.},

  abstract = {Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes.[1] It examines what cognition is, what it does and how it works. It includes research on intelligence and behavior, especially focusing on how information is represented, processed, and transformed (in faculties such as perception, language, memory, reasoning, and emotion) within nervous systems (human or other animal) and machines (e.g. computers). Cognitive science consists of multiple research disciplines, including psychology, artificial intelligence, philosophy, neuroscience, linguistics, and anthropology.[2] It spans many levels of analysis, from low-level learning and decision mechanisms to high-level logic and planning; from neural circuitry to modular brain organization. The fundamental concept of cognitive science is "that thinking can best be understood in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures."[2]},

The term was originally used in his 1955 thesis "Logical Structures of Linguistic Theory" and in his 1956 paper "Three Models for the Description of Language".[1] Although the sentence is grammatically correct, no obvious understandable meaning can be derived from it, and thus it demonstrates the distinction between syntax and semantics. As an example of a category mistake, it was used to show inadequacy of the then-popular probabilistic models of grammar, and the need for more structured models.},

In this white paper I try to find the signal in the noise by taking a largely technical look at various definitions of network neutrality and the feasibility and complexity of implementing systems that support those ideas.First off, there are a lot of emotional terms used to describe various aspects of what makes the melting pot of the neutrality debate. For example, censorship or black-holing (where route filtering, fire-walling and port blocking might say what is happening in less insightful way); free-riding is often bandied about to describe the business of making money on the net (rather than overlay service provision); monopolistic tendencies, instead of the natural inclination of an organisation that owns a lot of kit that they've sunk capital into, to want to make revenue from it.The paper describes the basic realities of the net, which has never been a level playing field for many accidental and some deliberate reasons, and then looks at the future evolution of IP (and lower level) services; the evolution of overlay services, and the evolution of the structure of the ISP business space (access, core and other); finally, I appeal to simple minded economic and regulatory arguments to ask whether there is any case at all for \emph{special pleading} for the Internet as a special case, different from other services, or utilities.Mutatis mutandis.},

  abstract = {State requirements that high school graduates pass exit exams were the leading edge of the movement towards standards-based reform and continue to be adopted and refined by states today. In this study, we present new empirical evidence on how exit exams influenced educational attainment and labor market experiences using data from the 2000 Census and the National Center for Education Statistics' Common Core of Data (CCD). Our results suggest that the effects of these reforms have been heterogeneous. For example, our analysis of the Census data suggests that exit exams significantly reduced the probability of completing high school, particularly for black students. Similarly, our analysis of grade-level dropout data from the CCD indicates that Minnesota's recent exit exam increased the dropout rate in urban and high-poverty school districts as well as in those with a relatively large concentration of minority students. This increased risk of dropping out was concentrated among 12th grade students. However, we also found that Minnesota's exit exam lowered the dropout rate in low-poverty and suburban school districts, particularly among students in the 10th and 11th grades. These results suggest that exit exams have the capacity to improve student and school performance but also appear to have exacerbated the inequality in educational attainment.},

But little is known about what they learn when programming a game. In this article, we present a strategy for coding student games, and summarize the results of an analysis of 108 games created by middle school girls using Stagecast Creator in an after school class. The findings show that students engaged in moderate levels of complex programming activity, created games with moderate levels of usability, and that the games were characterized by low levels of code organization and documentation. These results provide evidence that game construction involving both design and programming activities can support the learning of computer science concepts.},

Watson's 1913 ``Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It,'' the so-called behaviorist manifesto, is examined in the context of its time and of its influence on the history of comparative psychology. The key ideas in the article were, a.) reliance on the experimental method, b.) prediction and control as goals of psychology, c.) elimination of the construct of consciousness d.) the importance of continuity of species, e.) direction of knowledge not solely toward humans, and f.) a role for instinctive behavior. These ideas can be seen to have been present before Watson and in the literature of his day. The article itself did not have a great immediate impact on psychology. Comparative psychology around 1913 had been strong but was entering a period of partial dormancy from which it recovered during the 1920s and 1930s. It was then that Watson' early work, and other work of the time, had their greatest impact. Comparative psychology matured in subsequent decades. The impact of behaviorism varied through different phases of its development. Watson's primary role was to integrate assorted ideas so as to form a fairly coherent package that he, a master salesman, could label and promulgate first to other psychologists and then to a broader public. His specific influences on comparative psychology are sometimes difficult to evaluate. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

However, most studies on gender differences in computer work failed to relate to the large body of research on gender differences in math and science. The study reported here tests whether the model of achievement-related choices, which was originally developed for the math domain, can be used to explain gender differences in computer work. A causal sequence deduced from the model was tested using path analysis. According to the results, the intensity of computer use can be predicted from the computer-specific self-concept of ability that was effected by computer-specific attributions. Gender differences emerged on the means of these variables. Furthermore, the intended choice of computers in a specific situation could be effectively explained by computer-specific self-concept of ability. This effect was mediated by the expectation of success and the perception of the value of computers. Values also affected expectations. For this causal sequence, gender differences emerged only with regard to self-concept of ability and expectancy. Supporting the assumptions of the model of achievement-related choices, the path coefficients did not vary as a function of gender.},

The authors tested the importance of 1 noncognitive trait: grit. Defined as perseverance and passion for long-term goals, grit accounted for an average of 4\% of the variance in success outcomes, including educational attainment among 2 samples of adults (N ϭ 1,545 and N ϭ 690), grade point average among Ivy League undergraduates (N ϭ 138), retention in 2 classes of United States Military Academy, West Point, cadets (N ϭ 1,218 and N ϭ 1,308), and ranking in the National Spelling Bee (N ϭ 175). Grit did not relate positively to IQ but was highly correlated with Big Five Conscientiousness. Grit nonetheless demonstrated incremental predictive validity of success measures over and beyond IQ and conscientiousness. Collectively, these findings suggest that the achievement of difficult goals entails not only talent but also the sustained and focused application of talent over time.},

The three different groups are consisted of students from: (1) programming courses of Greek Lyceums, (2) computer science courses at German Gymnasiums and (3) at the Department of Informatics (freshmen) at the Ionian University, Greece. We asked the three different groups of students to complete a questionnaire that was derived from this combination of the prior theories. The results revealed several differences in the measured variables, e.g. the freshmen who should have the highest programming competencies compared to the other two groups expressed the lowest degree of self-efficacy. The overall outcomes are expected to contribute to the understanding of students' likelihood to pursue computing related careers and promote the acceptance of CSE.},

We use three longitudinal data sets of high school graduates in 1957, 1972, and 1992 to understand the narrowing of the gender gap in college and its reversal. From 1972 to 1992 high school girls narrowed the gap with boys in math and science course taking and in achievement test scores. These variables, which we term the proximate determinants, can account for 30 to 60 percent of the relative increase in women's college completion rate. Behind these changes were several others: the future work expectations of young women increased greatly between 1968 and 1979 and the age at first marriage for college graduate women rose by 2.5 years in the 1970s, allowing them to be more serious students. The reversal of the college gender gap, rather than just its elimination, was due in part to the persistence of behavioral and developmental differences between males and females.},

And yet, among the vast body of empirical research examining how input factors relate to academic outcomes, few investigations have honed in on the precision of the relationship between individual attendance and student achievement. The purpose of this article is to provide insight into this relationship. Specifically, this study has evaluated the hypothesis that the number of days a student was present in school positively affected learning outcomes. To assess this, a unique empirical approach was taken in order to evaluate a comprehensive dataset of elementary and middle school students in the Philadelphia School District. Employing a fixed effects framework and instrumental variables strategy, this study provides evidence from a quasi-experimental design geared at estimating the causal impact of attendance on multiple measures of achievement, including GPA and standardized reading and math test performance. The results consistently indicate positive and statistically significant relationships between student attendance and academic achievement for both elementary and middle school students.},

Part of the solution lies in retaining more of the female students currently enrolled; even more important, however, is increasing initial enrollment. Many believe lack of interest to be rooted in stereotypes of computer science formed early in high school: that it is a boring subject, devoid of interesting applications and stimulating only to 'geeks'. To attract high school females to CS, and to determine whether early exposure to the interesting breadth of CS and its applications might ameliorate such attitudes, a week-long Computer Science Seminar for Grade 9 and 10 girls was held at the University of Waterloo. The seminar consisted of lectures, labs and activities chosen to demonstrate the breadth of CS and to dispel the negative stereotypes. Pre- and post-seminar surveys indicate a substantial increase in interest, translating directly into increased desire to take high school CS courses.},

While most econometric attention has been directed at issues of simultaneous determination of peer interactions, we argue that issues of omitted and mismeasured variables are likely to be more important. We control for the most important determinants of achievement that will confound peer estimates by removing student and school-by-grade fixed effects in addition to observable family and school characteristics. The analysis also addresses the reciprocal nature of peer interactions and the interpretation of estimates based upon models using past achievement as the measure of peer group quality. The results indicate that peer achievement has a positive effect on achievement growth. Moreover, students throughout the school test score distribution appear to benefit from higher achieving schoolmates. On the other hand, the variance in achievement appears to have no systematic effect. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The present study was conducted in order to develop and validate the Computer Anxiety Rating Scale (CARS), by examining the behavioral, cognitive, and affective components of computer anxiety. The CARS was shown to be a reliable and valid measure. Higher levels of computer anxiety were related to greater math and test anxiety, and to less computer experience and mechanical interest. During an actual computer interaction, greater computer anxiety was associated with lower expectations and poorer task performance, as well as with greater state anxiety, reported physiological arousal, and debilitative thoughts. These results are consistent with a cognitive-attentional theory of computer anxiety and suggest directions for future research. Consistent differences between women and men on indices of computer anxiety were not found.},

The evidence reviewed indicates that exit tests have produced few of the expected benefits and have been associated with costs for the most disadvantaged students.

I identify the effects of peers whom a child encounters in the classroom using sources of variation that are credibly idiosyncratic, such as changes in the gender and racial composition of a grade in a school in adjacent years.  I use specification tests, including one based on randomizing the order of years, to confirm that the variation I use is not generated by time trends or other non-idiosyncratic forces.  I find that students are affected by the achievement level of their peers:  a credibly exogenous change of 1 point in peers' reading scores raises a student's own score between 0.15 and 0.4 points, depending on the specification.  Although I find little evidence that peer effects are generally non-linear, I do find that peer effects are stronger intra-race and that some effects do not operate through peers' achievement.  For instance, both males and females perform better in math in classrooms that are more female despite the fact that females' math performance is about the same as that of males.},

A total of 152 junior high school students in Seoul, Korea, participated in WBI during regular science classes. Participants completed motivational surveys before the onset of WBI and took the written and search tests at the end of WBI. Path analyses revealed that students' self-efficacy for self-regulated learning positively related to their academic self-efficacy, strategy use, and Internet self-efficacy. Academic self-efficacy predicted students' performance on the written test, which comprised problems on topics covered during the previous WBI sessions. Students' scores on the WBI search test were significantly and positively predicted by their self-efficacy in using the Internet. More interesting, students' academic self-efficacy beliefs were not able to predict their search test performance, whereas students' Internet self-efficacy beliefs were not able to predict their written test performance.},

The Shotokan Karate-do International Federation now has branches in more than 90 countries throughout the world, including the United States.In Black Belt Karate, this preeminent figure in the karate world offers a systematic approach to basic karate. Karate is a martial art that can be practiced by anyone, regardless of age or gender, and can be undertaken at any time during a person's life. The training system employed in karate is comprised of three main areas: kihon (basics), kumite (sparring) and kata (forms). Here, using meticulously detailed explanations and illustrative photos, Kanazawa offers an intensive self-study training course designed to be accessible to beginners, as well as to those who are already at an intermediate level. If practiced continuously and diligently over the course of a year, the practitioner will be able attain black-belt-level proficiency.},

All actions were recorded and time-stamped, allowing us to investigate the relationship between six factors that we believed would predict performance in an introductory computer science (CS) course (as measured by course grade) and how much students would learn from the tutorial (as measured by gain score from pre-test to post-test). These factors are: preparation (SAT score, number of previous CS courses taken, and pre-test score), time spent on the tutorial as a whole and on individual sections, amount and type of experimentation, programming accuracy and/or proficiency, approach to materials that involve mathematical formalisms, and approach to learning highly unfamiliar material (string manipulation procedures). Gender differences with respect to these factors were also investigated.Predictors of grade and gain score included SAT score, pre-test score (negatively correlated with gain), time (negatively correlated with gain and grade), and various measures of programming accuracy and/or proficiency---for example, the total number of program runs that contained errors (negatively correlated with grade and gain). Several measures of experimentation predicted gain score. Experimentation also predicted grade, but only as applied to the least familiar tutorial material. Although experimentation was practiced throughout the tutorial by both sexes, male and female students differed with respect to the types of tutorial topics and tasks they experimented with and the degree of experimentation---for example, male students were more likely to write programs not suggested by the tutorial. These findings suggest that a tutorial such as the one used in this study could serve as an instrument to identify students who are likely to succeed (or not) in an introductory CS course, and that instructional interventions to promote achievement should encourage experimentation, reflection on the results of experiments, care and accuracy.},

We then outline our course design, showing how we have created problem-based learning courses. The paper reports our evaluation of the approach. This has two parts: assessment of a trial, with a three-year longitudinal follow-up of the students; reports of student learning improve-ment after we had become experienced in full implementation of PBL. We conclude with a summary of our experience over three years of PBL teaching and discuss some of the pragmatic issues around introducing the radical change in teaching, maintaining staff support, and continuing refinement of our PBL teaching. We also discuss some of our approaches to the commonly acknowledged challenges of PBL teaching.}

The Seventh Edition reflects several developments within the field of behavior modification, without diminishing an essential emphasis on applied research and intervention techniques. Kazdin has expanded and refined discussions of functional behavioral assessment, antecedent events and their influence on behavior, assessment options, ensuring the quality of assessment, data evaluation, and ethical and legal issues. New to this edition is an Appendix to guide a behavior-change project that focuses on applying the content of the book in everyday life.In addition to comprehensive coverage and lucid explanations of how assessment, evaluation, and intervention work together to improve the care of individuals, the text contains many learning-oriented features, such as chapter outlines that convey content, direction, and key points; practical examples of principles and techniques; an abundant number of tables that summarize important concepts; exercises for designing or evaluating a specific intervention or for changing a program that is not working; and a list of key terms at the end of the chapters. By completing the exercises and understanding the terms, students can master the core content of the chapters.This outstanding text enables students and professionals with varied interests to implement effective techniques with individuals and in contexts where behavior change is desperately neededin a world challenged by a wide range of social problems.},

Results: Overall, tailored messages appear to stimulate greater cognitive activity than do messages that are not tailored. However, non-tailored messages that happen to be a good fit for a given individual also have similar effects. Conclusion: Health communication programs and materials that succeed in making information relevant to their intended audience will be more effective than those that do not. Tailoring is a proven approach to enhancing message relevance, but not the only approach to do so, and under many circumstances may not be the preferred choice.},

Modern technological developments bring great promise for the realization of such large-scale persuasive behavior change interventions because they allow for user tailored interaction. For the effective tailoring of technology-based interventions, a profound understanding of the main variables underlying physical activity behavior is required. In this paper, we focus on three cognitive variables that have shown to be crucial for the adoption and maintenance of health behaviors: behavioral regulation, types of motives, and self-efficacy. In particular, we explore the relationship of these cognitive variables with actual levels of daily-life physical activity. Our study differs from related studies in two important ways. First, we consider the entire range of physical activities performed throughout the day while many studies focused on sports and or dedicated exercise. Second, we employ a wearable device for the objective measurement of daily physical activity levels rather than rely on self-report measures. Our results show that active individuals feel higher levels of self-determined behavioral regulation, experience stronger motives to be active (in particular for health and well-being related motives), and have higher levels of self-efficacy for daily-life physical activity than inactive individuals. We argue that tailored technology-based activity interventions should accommodate these cognitive variables and for inactive individuals, aim to gradually induce and internalize the cognitions already experienced by active individuals.},

  abstract = {Peer Instruction (PI) is an active learning pedagogical technique. PI lectures present students with a series of multiple-choice questions, which they respond to both individually and in groups. PI has been widely successful in the physical sciences and, recently, has been successfully adopted by computer science instructors in lower-division, introductory courses. In this work, we challenge readers to consider PI for their upper-division courses as well. We present a PI curriculum for two upper-division computer science courses: Computer Architecture and Theory of Computation. These courses exemplify several perceived challenges to the adoption of PI in upper-division courses, including: exploration of abstract ideas, development of high-level judgment of engineering design trade-offs, and exercising advanced mathematical sophistication. This work includes selected course materials illustrating how these challenges are overcome, learning gains results comparing these upper-division courses with previous lower-division results in the literature, student attitudinal survey results (N = 501), and pragmatic advice to prospective developers and adopters. We present three main findings. First, we find that these upper-division courses achieved student learning gains equivalent to those reported in successful lower-division computing courses. Second, we find that student feedback for each class was overwhelmingly positive, with 88\% of students recommending PI for use in other computer science classes. Third, we find that instructors adopting the materials introduced here were able to replicate the outcomes of the instructors who developed the materials in terms of student learning gains and student feedback.},

  abstract = {Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT; Lent, Brown, \& Hackett, 1994) is a fairly recent approach to understanding the career puzzle. It is intended to offer a unifying framework for bringing together common pieces, or elements, identified by previous career theorists--such as Super, Holland, Krumboltz, and Lofquist and Dawis--and arranging them into a novel rendering of how people (1) develop vocational interests, (2) make (and remake) occupational choices, and (3) achieve varying levels of career success and stability. The primary foundation for this approach lies in Bandura's (1986) general social cognitive theory, which emphasizes the complex ways in which people, their behavior, and environments mutually influence one another. Taking its cue from Bandura's theory, SCCT highlights people's capacity to direct their own vocational behavior (human agency)--to assemble their own puzzle, so to speak--yet it also acknowledges the many personal and environmental influences (e.g., sociostructural barriers and supports, culture, disability status) that serve to strengthen, weaken, or, in some cases, even override human agency in career development. This chapter contains three main sections: (1) an overview of SCCT's basic elements and predictions; (2) a brief summary of the theory's research base, including study of diverse populations (e.g., people of color, women, persons with disabilities, gay and lesbian workers); and (3) consideration of developmental and counseling applications--that is, how SCCT can be used as a source of ideas for maximizing career options, fostering career choice-making and implementation, and promoting career success and satisfaction.},

As predicted by theory, individuals contributed when they were reminded of their uniqueness and when they were given specific and challenging goals. However, other predictions were disconfirmed.

  abstract = {The 17th Century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes is nowwidely regarded as one of a handful of truly great politicalphilosophers, whose masterwork Leviathan rivals insignificance the political writings of Plato, Aristotle, Locke,Rousseau, Kant, and Rawls. Hobbes is famous for his early andelaborate development of what has come to be known as ``socialcontract theory'', the method of justifying political principlesor arrangements by appeal to the agreement that would be made amongsuitably situated rational, free, and equal persons. He is infamousfor having used the social contract method to arrive at theastonishing conclusion that we ought to submit to the authority of anabsolute\textemdash undivided and unlimited\textemdash sovereign power. Whilehis methodological innovation had a profound constructive impact onsubsequent work in political philosophy, his substantive conclusionshave served mostly as a foil for the development of more palatablephilosophical positions.  Hobbes's moral philosophy has been lessinfluential than his political philosophy, in part because that theoryis too ambiguous to have garnered any general consensus as to itscontent. Most scholars have taken Hobbes to have affirmed some sort ofpersonal relativism or subjectivism; but views that Hobbes espouseddivine command theory, virtue ethics, rule egoism, or a form ofprojectivism also find support in Hobbes's texts and amongscholars. Because Hobbes held that ``the true doctrine of theLawes of Nature is the true Morall philosophie'', differences ininterpretation of Hobbes's moral philosophy can be traced to differingunderstandings of the status and operation of Hobbes's ``laws ofnature'', which laws will be discussed below. The formerlydominant view that Hobbes espoused psychological egoism as thefoundation of his moral theory is currently widely rejected, and therehas been to date no fully systematic study of Hobbes's moralpsychology.,  Copyright \textcopyright{} 2014 bySharon A.

There is a strong negative correlation between baseline self-efficacy and changes in self-efficacy, which may explain previous research in which baseline self-efficacy alone did not predict subsequent behavioral enactments.},

Thus a number of by-ways appear which, it is hoped, may amuse the professional, and help to tempt back to the subject those who thought they were losing interest.' The standard of knowledge expected is fairly elementary. In most cases a straightforward statement of the fallacious argument is followed by an exposure in which the error is traced to the most elementary source, and this process often leads to an analysis which is often of unexpected depth. Many students will discover just how mathematically minded they are when they read this book; nor is that the only discovery they will make.

  abstract = {In computer science, an expected outcome of a student's education is programming skill. This working group investigated the programming competency students have as they complete their first one or two courses in computer science. In order to explore options for assessing students, the working group developed a trial assessment of whether students can program. The underlying goal of this work was to initiate dialog in the Computer Science community on how to develop these types of assessments. Several universities participated in our trial assessment and the disappointing results suggest that many students do not know how to program at the conclusion of their introductory courses. For a combined sample of 216 students from four universities, the average score was 22.89 out of 110 points on the general evaluation criteria developed for this study. From this trial assessment we developed a framework of expectations for first-year courses and suggestions for further work to develop more comprehensive assessments.},

Previous efforts to assess computer averse states are reviewed, and it is argued that a self-report instrument could be useful in detecting negative reactions to computers. The Computer Aversion Scale (CAVS) is based on three expectancy categories (efficacy, outcome, and reinforcement expectations) derived from social learning theory. Data analyses demonstrated moderate to high reliability and validity estimates for CAVS total score and three expectancy subscales. In addition, a study using a modified CAVS was shown to predict poor performance on a computer-based test of cognitive abilities and to moderate a relationship between mood and memory measures. Implications of CAVS findings for psychological assessment via computer are discussed.},

Having realistic estimates at an early stage in a project's life-cycle allow project managers and development organisations to manage resources effectively. Prediction is a necessary part of an effective process, be it authoring, design, testing, or Web development as a whole. The first part of this paper describes a case study evaluation (CSE) where we measured the characteristics of Web applications and the effort involved in designing and authoring those applications. The second half presents two prediction models generated using statistical techniques, namely linear regression and stepwise multiple regression. The prediction power of the models employed is then compared using boxplots of the residuals. The results suggest that stepwise regression gives better predictions than linear regression},

Participants answered general information questions, expressed their confidence in the correctness of their answers, and were given true or false feedback. In all five experiments, participants hypercorrected when they had made a mistake; that is, they remembered better the correct feedback to errors made with high compared to low confidence. However, in none of the experiments did participants hyper'correct' when false feedback followed an initially correct response. Telling people whether the feedback was right or wrong made little difference, suggesting that people already knew whether the feedback was true or false and differentially encoded the true feedback compared to the false feedback. An exception occurred when false feedback followed an error: participants hyper'corrected' to this false feedback, suggesting that when people are wrong initially, they are susceptible to further incorrect information. These results indicate that people have some kind of privileged access to whether their answers are right or wrong, above and beyond their confidence ratings, and that they behave differently when trying to remember new ``corrective'' information depending upon whether they, themselves, were right or wrong initially. The likely source of this additional information is knowledge about the truth of the feedback, which they rapidly process and use to modulate memory encoding.},

Men rated themselves higher than did women for perceived self-efficacy.

We interviewed eight instructors a year  after they attended workshops on several innovative introductory  Computer Science (intro CS) cour ses at undergraduate level. The  interview was designed to elicit the  extent to which instructors had  adopted or adapted what they learned from the workshops, and  what drove or prevented their efforts to make curriculum change.  The results of this study reveal that the adoption and adaptation of  computing curriculum innovations in  new situations may involve  systemic change affecting instruct ors, departments and institutions  as a whole. The findings of this  study suggest a list of questions  that a computing instructor might ask before committing to a new  innovation. We also consider im plications of this study for  disseminating computing  education innovations.},

  abstract = {http://www.singularityweblog.com/noam-chomsky-the-singularity-is-science-fiction/ Dr. Noam Chomsky is a famed linguist, political activist, prolific author and recognized public speaker, who has spent the last 60 years living a double life -- one as a political activist and another as a linguist. His activism allegedly made him the US government's public enemy number one. As a linguist he is often credited for dethroning behaviorism and becoming the "father of modern linguistics" (and/or cognitive science). Put together his accomplishments are the reasons why he is often listed as one of the most important intellectuals of the 20th century. And so I was very much looking forward to interviewing him on Singularity 1 on 1. Unfortunately our time together was delayed, then rushed and a bit shorter than anticipated. So I was pretty nervous throughout and messed up some of my questions and timing. Never-the-less, I believe that we still had a worthy conversation with Dr. Chomsky and I appreciate the generous though limited time that he was able to grant me. During our 28 minute conversation with Noam Chomsky we cover a variety of interesting topics such as: the balance between his academic and his political life; artificial intelligence and reverse engineering the human brain; why in his view both Deep Blue and Watson are little more than PR; the slow but substantial progress of our civilization; the technological singularity...},

Developers of innovative curricula and tools for CS education want teachers to adopt their new approaches. What convinces a CS teacher to change and adopt something new--or not? This paper explores factors that influence CS teachers' adoption and change. We studied our workshop participants to determine factors influencing their decision on whether to adopt a new CS curriculum. The results from our study indicate that multiple factors, some surprising, influence CS teachers' adoption. Our findings suggest that teacher excitement in a new approach drives adoption, while more organizational or social issues inhibit adoption.},

In addition to increasing the number of high school (HS) CS teachers, there is a great need for supporting those teachers to grow and stay as committed, effective teachers. Recent literature  on  teacher  education  suggests  that  teachers'  sense  of commitment and  (other aspects of) teaching profession is tightly linked    with    their    teacher    identity.    However,    the    current educational system in the U.S. does not provide typical contexts for teachers to build a sense of identity as CS teachers. This study is  intended  to  gain  an  initial  understanding  of  CS  teachers' perceptions  about  their  own  professional  identity  and  potential factors  that  might  contribute  to  these  perceptions.  Our  findings indicate  that  current  HS  teachers  teaching  CS  courses  do  not necessarily   identify   themselves   as   CS   teachers.   They   have different perceptions related to CS teaching. Four kinds of factors can    contribute    to    these    perceptions:    teachers'   educational background   and   certification,   CS   curriculum   and   department hierarchy,  availability  of  CS  teacher  community,  and  teachers' perceptions about the field of CS},

It will (1) introduce the archetypes of behavior change via BCSSs, (2) describe the design process for building persuasive BCSSs, and (3) exemplify research into BCSSs through the domain of health interventions.

This classical model assumes that each project is offered by one lecturer and that preference lists are strictly ordered. Here, we study a generalisation of SPA-S where ties are allowed in the preference lists of students and lecturers, which we refer to as the Student-Project Allocation problem with lecturer preferences over Students with Ties (SPA-ST). We investigate stable matchings under the most robust definition of stability in this context, namely super-stability. We describe the first polynomial-time algorithm to find a super-stable matching or to report that no such matching exists, given an instance of SPA-ST. Our algorithm runs in \$O(L)\$ time, where \$L\$ is the total length of all the preference lists. Finally, we present results obtained from an empirical evaluation of the linear-time algorithm based on randomly-generated SPA-ST instances. Our main finding is that, whilst super-stable matchings can be elusive when ties are present in the students' and lecturers' preference lists, the probability of such a matching existing is significantly higher if ties are restricted to the lecturers' preference lists.},

The analysis shows that students who barely failed the exam were more likely to exit than those who barely passed, despite being offered retest opportunities. The discontinuity amounts to a large proportion of the dropout probability of barely failers, particularly for limited-English-proficiency, racial-minority, and low-income students, suggesting that the potential benefit of raising educational standards might come at the cost of increasing inequality in the educational system.},

After systematically searching online bibliographic databases, 34 relevant articles were located and included in the study. Following the categorization scheme proposed by [Dempsey, J., Rasmussen, K., \&amp; Lucassen, B. (1996). The instructional gaming literature: Implications and 99 sources. University of South Alabama, College of Education, Technical Report No. 96-1], those articles were grouped into the following four categories: (a) research, (b) development, (c) discussion and (d) theory. The overviewed articles suggest that electronic games present many potential benefits as educational tools for HE and PE, and that those games may improve young people's knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviours in relation to health and physical exercise. Furthermore, the newly emerged physically interactive electronic games can potentially enhance young people's physical fitness, motor skills and motivation for physical exercise. The empirical evidence to support the educational effectiveness of electronic games in HE and PE is still rather limited, but the findings present a positive picture overall. The outcomes of the literature review are discussed in terms of their implications for future research, and can provide useful guidance to educators, practitioners and researchers in the areas of HE and PE, and to electronic game designers.},

This program integrates good mentoring practice and pedagogy, including problem-based learning. Special attention is paid to creating a cohort of students who come together every week to learn about the research process, and ethical and societal issues related to it. Each student takes a small project from the proposal stage, through design and implementation, to publication and presentation. We report on the first two years of the program.},

The theory provides an integrative framework for analyzing the antecedents and effects of emotions experienced in achievement and academic settings. It is based on the premise that appraisals of control and values are central to the arousal of achievement emotions, including activity-related emotions such as enjoyment, frustration, and boredom experienced at learning, as well as outcome emotions such as joy, hope, pride, anxiety, hopelessness, shame, and anger relating to success or failure. Corollaries of the theory pertain to the multiplicity and domain specificity of achievement emotions; to their more distal individual and social antecedents, their effects on engagement and achievement, and the reciprocal linkages between emotions, antecedents and effects; to the regulation and development of these emotions; and to their relative universality across genders and cultures. Implications addressed concern the conceptual integration of emotion, motivation, and cognition, and the need to advance mixed-method paradigms. In closing, implications for educational practice are discussed.},

Solving Plato's Problem involves explaining the gap between what one knows and the apparent lack of substantive input from experience (the environment). Plato's Problem is most clearly illustrated in the Meno dialogue, in which Socrates demonstrates that an uneducated boy nevertheless understands geometric principles.},

Evaluating 10 years of instruction of 4 different courses spanning 16 PI course instances, we find that adoption of the PI methodology in the classroom reduces fail rates by a per-course average of 61\% (20\% reduced to 7\%) compared to standard instruction (SI). Moreover, we also find statistically significant improvements within-instructor. For the same instructor teaching the same course, we find PI decreases the fail rate, on average, by 67\% (from 23\% to 8\%) compared to SI. As an in-situ study, we discuss the various threats to the validity of this work and consider implications of wide-spread adoption of PI in computing programs.},

Through common measurements of student perceptions, we provide evidence that introductory computing instructors can successfully implement PI in their classrooms. We find encouraging minimum (74\%) and average (92\%) levels of success as measured through student valuation of PI for their learning.

But are these students really learning, or are they just "copying" the right answer from someone in their group? In an article in the journal Science, Smith et al. affirm that genetics students individually learn from discussion: having discussed a first question with their peers, students are better able to correctly, individually answer a second, conceptually-related question. We replicate their study, finding that students in upper-division computing courses (architecture and theory of computation) also learn from peer discussions, and explore differences between our results and those of Smith et al. Our work reveals that using raw percentage gains between paired questions may not fully illuminate the value of peer discussion. We define a new metric, Weighted Learning Gain, which better reflects the learning value of discussion. By applying this metric to both genetics and computing courses, we consistently find that 85-89\% of "potential learners" benefit from peer discussion.},

The information technology revolution is transforming almost every aspect of society, but girls and women are largely out of the loop. Although women surf the Web in equal numbers to men and make a majority of online purchases, few are involved in the design and creation of new technology. It is mostly men whose perspectives and priorities inform the development of computing innovations and who reap the lion's share of the financial rewards. As only a small fraction of high school and college computer science students are female, the field is likely to remain a "male clubhouse," absent major changes.In Unlocking the Clubhouse, social scientist Jane Margolis and computer scientist and educator Allan Fisher examine the many influences contributing to the gender gap in computing. The book is based on interviews with more than 100 computer science students of both sexes from Carnegie Mellon University, a major center of computer science research, over a period of four years, as well as classroom observations and conversations with hundreds of college and high school faculty. The interviews capture the dynamic details of the female computing experience, from the family computer kept in a brother's bedroom to women's feelings of alienation in college computing classes. The authors investigate the familial, educational, and institutional origins of the computing gender gap. They also describe educational reforms that have made a dramatic difference at Carnegie Mellon\textemdash where the percentage of women entering the School of Computer Science rose from 7\% in 1995 to 42\% in 2000\textemdash and at high schools around the country.},

Self-efficacy is an individual's judgment of his or her ability to perform a task within a specific domain [1]. A mental model is a person's internal (mental) representation of real world objects and systems [9]. Research has shown that high self-efficacy and a good mental model are important to knowledge acquisition and transfer. This research investigates the effects of students' self-efficacy and mental models of programming on learning to program. The results show that self-efficacy for programming is influenced by previous programming experience and increases as a student progresses through an introductory programming course. The results also show that the student's mental model of programming influences self-efficacy and that both the mental model and self-efficacy affect course performance.},

  abstract = {The increasing use of state-mandated public high school exit exams is one manifestation of the current movement in U.S. public schooling toward more explicit standards of instruction and accountability. Exit exam requirements implicitly argue that raising the bar for graduation creates incentives both for students to work harder in school and for schools to increase their efforts for low-achieving students. Such incentives should most strongly affect the motivation of students who fail an exit exam the first time they take the test because failing provides a clear signal of students' need to improve their academic skills. Others argue that failing an exit exam discourages low-achieving students from staying in school. In this article, the authors use a regression discontinuity design and student-level longitudinal data from four large California public school districts to estimate the effect of failing a high school exit exam in 10th grade on subsequent student achievement, course taking, persistence in high school, and graduation. The analyses show no evidence of any significant or sizeable effect of failing the exam on high school course-taking, achievement, persistence, or graduation for students with test scores near the exit exam passing score. In each case, the estimates are precise enough to rule out modest to large effects. This implies that the negative impacts of high school exit exam policies on graduation rates found in other studies are more likely a result of reduced graduation rates of very low-achieving students than of discouragement of marginally low-achieving students.},

We studied the dependence of influx and efflux on internal and external pH and [beta-hydroxybutyrate]. Lowering external pH from 8.0 to 7.3 to 6.6 enhanced influx into erythrocytes by lowering entry Km from 29 to 16 to 10 mM, entry V being independent of external pH. Lowering external pH inhibited efflux. At low external pH, external beta-hydroxybutyrate enhanced efflux slightly. At high external pH, external beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibited efflux. Internal acidification inhibited influx and internal alkalization enhanced influx. Internal beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) enhanced influx more in acidified than alkalized cells. These data are compatible with coupled betaHB-/OH- exchange, betaHB- and OH- competing for influx, C:OH- moving faster than C: betaHB-, empty C being immobile. They are also compatible with coupled betaHB-/H+ copermeation, empty C moving inward faster than H+:C:betaHB-, H+:C being immobile, and C:betaHB- (without H+) being so unstable as not to be formed in significant amounts (relative to C, H+:C, and H+:C:betaHB-).},

  abstract = {Our study utilizes data from a national cohort of eighth-grade students to consider how different gender and racial/ethnic subgroups compare to White males in their likelihood to aspire toward a science or math occupation and examine the roles that self-concept, enjoyment, and achievement may play in shaping disparities at this early point in occupational trajectories. We find that the importance of enjoyment, self-concept, and achievement in explaining disparities in science career aspirations relative to White males varies according to the female subgroup considered, such that no singular story applies to females across different racial/ethnic backgrounds. For math, White and Hispanic females remain approximately half as likely as White males to aspire to a math occupation regardless of all indicators we consider. Finally, Black and Hispanic adolescent boys have generally comparable aspirations toward future careers in science and math as their White male peers, despite notably large differences in achievement. We discuss implications of our results for future research on equity. \textcopyright{} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed95: 458\textendash 476, 2011},

We describe a multivariate investigation of male and female university students' orientation to CIS careers. We focus on the roles of self-efficacy and peer-based social support as social-cognitive variables in the students' learning process. We explore these variables and their impact on career orientation through a set of overlapping regression models. In general, we find that strong social support and high self-efficacy are associated with strong orientation toward careers in CIS careers. However the influences of perceived self-efficacy and social support appear to differ for men and women: while low self-efficacy is tied to less social support for males, we see no similar tendency for females. In fact many females who report themselves as low in self-efficacy consider themselves to have high social support among their peers. We discuss the implications of our findings for programs aimed at outreach to both males and females regarding CIS education and careers.},

Most work in this area has concentrated on the ability of single factors (e.g. gender, math background, etc.) to predict success, with the exception of Wilson et al. (2001), which used a general linear model to gauge the effect of combined factors. In Rountree et al. (2002) we presented the results of a survey of our introductory programming class that considered factors (such as student expectations of success, among other things) in isolation. In this paper, we reassess the data from that survey by using a decision tree classifier to identify combinations of factors that interact to predict success or failure more strongly than single, isolated factors.},

  abstract = {Learning-related cellular modifications were studied in the rat piriform cortex. Water-deprived rats were divided to three groups: `trained' rats were trained in a four-arm maze to discriminate positive cues in pairs of odours, `control' rats were `pseudo-trained' by random water rewarding, and `naive' rats were water-deprived only. In one experimental paradigm, the trained group was exposed to extensive training with rats learning to discriminate between 35 and 50 pairs of odours. Piriform cortex pyramidal neurons from `trained', `control' and `naive' rats did not differ in their passive membrane properties and single spike characteristics. However, the after-hyperpolarizations (AHPs) that follow six-spike trains were reduced after `extensive training' by 43\% and 36\% compared with `control' and `naive', respectively. This effect was not observed in the piriform cortex of another group of rats, in which hyperexcitability was induced by chemical kindling. In another experimental paradigm rats were trained only until they demonstrated `rule learning', usually after discriminating between one and two pairs of odours (`mild training'). In this experiment, a smaller, yet significant, reduction (20\%) in AHPs was observed. AHP reduction was apparent in most of the sampled neurons. AHP remained reduced up to 3 days after the last training session. 5 days or more after the last training session, AHP amplitude recovered to pre-training value and did not differ between `trained' rats and the others. Accordingly, training suspension for 5 days or more resulted in slower learning of novel odours. We suggest that increased neuronal excitability, manifested as reduced AHP, is related to the ability of the cortical network to enter a `learning mode' which creates favourable conditions for enhanced learning capability.},

The measure was administered to a sample of undergraduate psychology students (N = 293) along with the Computer Understanding and Experience Scale, the Computer Attitude Scale, and the Computer Aversion Scale. The factor structure of the CAAFI was supported via confirmatory factor analytic procedures and analysis of internal consistency reliability coefficients. In relation to the other measures of computer-related constructs, the strongest validity support was found for the CAAFI total score and Factors 1 (computer familiarity) and 3 (computer aversion-discomfort), followed by Factor 2 (computer attitudes). With regard to Factor 4 (computer aversion-fear), given the results of the analyses the decision was made to remove these items from the CAAFI in order to enhance the measure's psychometric properties and practical utility.},

It follows, then, that beliefs about the nature of programming aptitude (e.g., students' mindset) and the way in which individuals perceive themselves as programmers (e.g., students' self-concept) could also have a salient impact on programming practice behaviour and the development of programming expertise. However, in order to test this hypothesis, a valid and reliable measurement instrument is needed. This paper draws upon the Control-Value Theory of Achievement Emotion to assemble such a measurement instrument. An evaluation of the proposed measurement instrument with three cohorts of undergraduate computing students (N=239) then demonstrates that reliability and construct validity are adequate, while the concurrent validity of the conceptual framework is satisfactory. This suggests that the measurement instrument is suitable for further research into students' self-beliefs within the introductory programming context. However, it is important to note that this work represents only a first step and further validation is required to establish whether the measurement instrument is valid across different contexts and populations.},

The literature cites a number of plausible explanations for the problem, but no definitive answers. We conducted a study to determine why few women complete our own computer science major. Our major finding is that (at least on our campus) the problem is not actually one of retention. Few women---even those in the introductory computer science courses---actually plan to major in computer science to begin with. Although some barriers suggested in the literature do operate within the major, they seem much less significant than the low entry rates. Retention of women once they enter the major is important, but it is secondary to getting women into the major initially. This suggests that the most effective solutions will be those that concentrate not on retention but on recruitment (including outreach to secondary schools).},

  abstract = {Worldwide, there is a significant discrepancy between the numbers of male and female graduates from computer science programs. SUNY Geneseo offers no exception. The literature cites a number of plausible explanations for the problem, but no definitive answers. We conducted a study to determine why few women complete our own computer science major. Our major finding is that (at least on our campus) the problem is not actually one of retention. Few women---even those in the introductory computer science courses---actually plan to major in computer science to begin with. Although some barriers suggested in the literature do operate within the major, they seem much less significant than the low entry rates. Retention of women once they enter the major is important, but it is secondary to getting women into the major initially. This suggests that the most effective solutions will be those that concentrate not on retention but on recruitment (including outreach to secondary schools).},

  abstract = {Games are an important part of popular culture and have successfully engaged audiences from different age groups [8]. This has caused many educators to start thinking of different ways to infuse game-based techniques (playing or construction) to enhance education. Over the past five years, there has been several research efforts on curriculum development and the evaluation of game construction and playing methods to promote STEM (Science Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) concepts to middle and high school students. In this paper, we report on a new study following the lead of previous efforts. In particular, we were granted a block within Frank Hurt High School by the Surrey school district for which to develop a game construction-based curriculum as a basis for computer science education within the school, replacing a traditional computer science class. From February till June 2011 students were taught elementary programming using GameMaker, a digital game development tool. In addition to collecting students' overall impressions, we also evaluated students' technical competency (using tests) and self-efficacy (using surveys) at the start and end of the semester. Our findings show that the curriculum had a positive, statistically significant effect on concept comprehension, which suggests that the curriculum was effective for understanding computer science and game design concepts. In this paper we present the course structure, methods, and evaluation as a contribution.},

Whilst Computer Science education has been investigated in some depth at university level, there is less in-depth research into how Computing is learned in schools and the difficulties that students have. The study described in this short poster was an attempt to listen to students and reflect on their experiences of Computing. The project was carried out over a period of two years by a teacher of Computing in the UK, utilising data from 120 16-17 year old Computing students at various stages of a 2-year programme [7]. The intention of the project was to gain an understanding of what students were finding so difficult about Computing, and to trial small interventions with students, based on listening to their feedback. We wished to establish whether using different tools, adding more formative assessment, or introducing more collaborative working, helped to clear the fog that they were experiencing with regards to progress in Computing. These students may be our future university Computer Science students and as such our success in motivating and retaining them is crucial to maintain student numbers in higher education. Our students are social young adults, who may not fit into the stereotypes of students who might be naturally good at Computing described by Stuart Wray [9]. Being able to take time to listen to these students and help them to develop their skills in Computing might help us to retain young students and subsequently address the skills gap that we have in the UK caused by a lack of suitably qualified professionals [4].},

  abstract = {The current paper examines the instructional implications of Vygotsky's (1978) seminal notion of Zone of Proximal Development, originally developed to account for the learning potential of children, and investigates ZPD applications to the concept of teacher professional development. Specific attempt has been made to see how a number of assets at the teacher's disposal namely diary writing, peer and mentor collaboration, action research, practicum and TESOL discourse can serve as scaffolders to affect the progression of ZPD in language teachers. The contributions of ZPD to the concepts of scaffolding and dynamic assessment (DA) are explored extensively and the controversial issues are addressed. There is a consensus that the notion of the zone of proximal development and socio-cultural theory of mind based on Vygotsky's ideas are at the heart of the notion of scaffolding. This study highlights the limitations of the metaphor of scaffolding in interpreting the zone of proximal development. The concept of ZPD, as seen through the approach of DA, offers an operational view of the learners' actual level of development and a measure of emerging and imminent development. Utilizing the concept of ZPD, DA unites traditional assessment, instruction, intervention, and remediation. Though the concept of ZPD provides an attractive metaphor for designing instruction and analyzing learning, it poses a real challenge when put into practice. The present research highlights a procedure to provide a more tangible account of ZPD, but research on this area is scanty and further explorations and investigations are needed to reflect the implications of ZPD in instructional context.},

Subjects were recruited from large urban asthma clinics, community clinics, and schools. Seventy-six children 9 to 13 years old were recruited for the evaluation.Results: Repeated-measures analysis of covariance showed that knowledge scores increased significantly for both groups, but no between-group differences were found (P = 0.55); children using the program scored significantly higher (P {$<$} 0.01) on questions about steps of self-regulation, prevention strategies, and treatment strategies. These children also demonstrated greater selfefficacy (P {$<$} 0.05) and more efficacy building attribution classification of asthma self-management behaviors (P {$<$} 0.05) than those children who did not use the program.Conclusion: The WDTA is an intrinsically motivating educational program that has the ability to effect determinants of asthma self-management behavior in 9- to 13-year-old children with asthma. This, coupled with its reported effectiveness in enhancing patient outcomes in clinical settings, indicates that this program has application in pediatric asthma education.},

The results indicate that a deep approach to learning was positively correlated with mark for the course, while a surface approach was negatively correlated; spatial visualisation skills are correlated with success; a progression of map drawing styles identified in the literature has a significant correlation with marks; and increasing measures of richness of articulation of a search strategy are also associated with higher marks. Finally, a qualitative analysis of short interviews identified the qualities that students themselves regarded as important to success in programming.},

Skinner argues that verbal behavior requires a separate analysis because it does not operate on the environment directly, but rather through the behavior of other peoples in a verbal community. He illustrates his thesis with examples from literature, the arts, and the sciences, as well as from his own verbal behavior and that of his colleagues and children.},

  abstract = {In mathematics, economics and computer science, particularly in the fields of combinatorics, game theory and algorithms, the stable-roommate problem (SRP)  is the problem of finding a stable matching for an even-sized set. A matching is a separation of the set into disjoint pairs ("roommates"). The matching is stable if there are no two elements which are not roommates and which both prefer each other to their roommate under the matching.  This is distinct from the stable-marriage problem in that the stable-roommates problem allows matches between any two elements, not just between classes of "men" and "women". It is commonly stated as: In a given instance of the stable-roommates problem (SRP), each of 2n participants ranks the others in strict order of preference. A matching is a set of n disjoint pairs of participants. A matching M in an instance of SRP is stable if there are no two participants x and y, each of whom prefers the other to their partner in M. Such a pair is said to block M, or to be a blocking pair with respect to M.},

  abstract = {Abstract. This paper offers an insight into the games software development process from a time perspective by drawing on an in-depth study in a games development organization. The wider market for computer games now exceeds the annual global revenues of cinema. We have, however, only a limited scholarly understanding of how games studios produce games. Games projects require particular attention because their context is unique. Drawing on a case study, the paper offers a theoretical conceptualization of the development process of creative software, such as games software. We found that the process, as constituted by the interactions of developers, oscillates between two modes of practice: routinized and improvised, which sediment and flux the working rhythms in the context. This paper argues that while we may predeterminately lay down the broad stages of creative software development, the activities that constitute each stage, and the transition criteria from one to the next, may be left to the actors in the moment, to the temporality of the situation as it emerges. If all development activities are predefined, as advocated in various process models, this may leave little room for opportunity and the creative fruits that flow from opportunity, such as enhanced features, aesthetics and learning.},

Using an instrumented version of BlueJ, an integrated development environment for Java, we collected novice compilations and explored the errors novices encountered, the locations of these errors, and the frequency with which novices compiled their programs. We identified which frequently encountered errors and which compilation behaviors were characteristic of at-risk students. Based on these findings, we developed linear regression models that allowed prediction of students' scores on a midterm exam. However, the models derived could not accurately predict the at-risk students. Although our goal of identifying at-risk students was not attained, we have gained insights regarding the compilation behavior of our students, which may help us identify students who are in need of intervention.},

The case method provides an interactive learning environment for students.

This book discusses, among many other topics, just how well marine mammals hear, how noisy the oceans have become, and what effects these new sounds have on marine mammals. The baseline of ambient noise, the sounds produced by machines and mammals, the sensitivity of marine mammal hearing, and the reactions of marine mammals are also examined. An essential addition to any marine biologist's library, Marine Mammals and Noise will be especially appealing to marine mammalogists, researchers, policy makers and regulators, and marine biologists and oceanographers using sound in their research.},

Researchers designed and developed a three-dimensional educational computer game. Twenty four students in fourth and fifth grades in a private school in Ankara, Turkey learnt about world continents and countries through this game for three weeks. The effects of the game environment on students' achievement and motivation and related implementation issues were examined through both quantitative and qualitative methods. An analysis of pre and post achievement tests showed that students made significant learning gains by participating in the game-based learning environment. When comparing their motivations while learning in the game-based learning environment and in their traditional school environment, it was found that students demonstrated statistically significant higher intrinsic motivations and statistically significant lower extrinsic motivations learning in the game-based environment. In addition, they had decreased focus on getting grades and they were more independent while participating in the game-based activities. These positive effects on learning and motivation, and the positive attitudes of students and teachers suggest that computer games can be used as an ICT tool in formal learning environments to support students in effective geography learning.},

  abstract = {John Locke (b. 1632, d. 1704) was a British philosopher, Oxfordacademic and medical researcher.  Locke's monumental An EssayConcerning Human Understanding (1689) is one of the first greatdefenses of empiricism and concerns itself with determining the limitsof human understanding in respect to a wide spectrum of topics. Itthus tells us in some detail what one can legitimately claim to knowand what one cannot. Locke's association with Anthony Ashley Cooper(later the First Earl of Shaftesbury) led him to become successively agovernment official charged with collecting information about tradeand colonies, economic writer, opposition political activist, andfinally a revolutionary whose cause ultimately triumphed in theGlorious Revolution of 1688. Among Locke's political works he is mostfamous for The Second Treatise of Government in which heargues that sovereignty resides in the people and explains the natureof legitimate government in terms of natural rights and the socialcontract.  He is also famous for calling for the separation of Churchand State in his Letter Concerning Toleration. Much ofLocke's work is characterized by opposition to authoritarianism. Thisis apparent both on the level of the individual person and on thelevel of institutions such as government and church. For theindividual, Locke wants each of us to use reason to search after truthrather than simply accept the opinion of authorities or be subject tosuperstition. He wants us to proportion assent to propositions to theevidence for them.  On the level of institutions it becomes importantto distinguish the legitimate from the illegitimate functions ofinstitutions and to make the corresponding distinction for the uses offorce by these institutions. Locke believes that using reason to tryto grasp the truth, and determine the legitimate functions ofinstitutions will optimize human flourishing for the individual andsociety both in respect to its material and spiritual welfare. This inturn, amounts to following natural law and the fulfillment of thedivine purpose for humanity.,  Copyright \textcopyright{} 2012 byWilliam Uzgalis{$<$}wuzgalis@oregonstate.edu{$>$}    , View this site from another server:,},

Both studies showed a significant relationship between feedback containing concrete suggestions and a successful uptake of the feedback. Regarding the different tools that were used, these concrete suggestions were more often produced in the Annotation system than in the Blackboard discussion forum, the latter showing more evaluative forms of feedback. We also found significant relationships between elements of both the nature and the reception of feedback on the one hand, and the use of this feedback by the receiver on the other hand.},

When compared to women's decisions, the decisions of men were more strongly influenced by their attitude toward using the new technology. In contrast, women were more strongly influenced by subjective norm and perceived behavioral control. Sustained technology usage behavior was driven by early usage behavior, thus fortifying the lasting influence of gender-based early evaluations of the new technology. These findings were robust across income, organization position, education, and computer self-efficacy levels.},

We include disciplines and instructors' end-of-course evaluation method as moderating variables. The results show that BL demonstrates a small summary effect (g+=0.385, p{$<$}0.001) compared to traditional teaching methods A significantly higher mean effect size was found in STEM disciplines (g+=0.496) compared to that of non-STEM disciplines (g+=0.210). Nevertheless, the weighted mean effect sizes reveal no significant differences regarding of end-of-course assessment methods, namely one-moment and multiple-component assessment. The finding confirms that BL is significantly associated with greater learning performance of STEM-disciplined students than with traditional classroom practice. Accordingly, discussion concerning the findings and implications for future research are elaborated.},

Fourteen years ago, in May of 1998, the UBC Department of Computer Science hosted the third version of this nascent conference. At that time the dot com boom was in full gear as the world was discovering the Internet and the bust was still two years away. The networking revolution that was taking place at that time, and continues to this day, eventually brought us Google, Facebook, twitter and enabled the iPad/iPhone, Android based devices, and the "cloud." Computer science enrolment was on the way up but that changed when the bubble burst. Many things changed in those intervening fourteen years, but what hasn't changed is the profound effect that computer science and information technology has continued to have on our day-to-day lives as the new ideas that often start in our colleges and universities percolate into society. A second thing that hasn't changed is the passion and dedication that the attendees to this conference continually display with respect to all aspects of computing education. As an organizing committee we have strived to put together a balanced program of panels, paper presentations, and technical sessions to stimulate, challenge, and provide you with ideas and tools to continue to fuel that passion. Again this year, the conference is being run in-cooperation with the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education and our proceedings will appear in the ACM Digital Library.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the combined effect of self-efficacy and academic integration on higher education students studying IT (Information Technology) majors in Taiwan. We introduced self-efficacy, which is a psychological factor that affects students' academic outcomes, as a new factor in Tinto' theory, a well-known framework in student retention research. Academic integration is the main proposition of Tinto's theory affecting students' decision to dropout. Students from different populations have various reasons from dropping out of their studies. An examination of the relationship between self-efficacy and academic integration is useful to understand the effect of self-efficacy on academic outcomes on the IT student population in Taiwan. Data from a Taiwanese national survey database conducted in 2005 was used to achieve the research objective. A total of 2,895 records were extracted from 75,084 students in public and private institutions studying in two IT-related Majors, namely Information Management (IM) and Computer Science (CS). MANOVA was used to analyze the interaction effects between academic integration and self-efficacy. The independent variables were institution types and students' majors. The results showed that students from public institutions have higher levels of self-efficacy than students from private ones. Another finding is that IM students seem to have better study strategies and habits than CS students. However, CS students were found to have better collaboration and satisfaction with their institutions than IM students. Team projects, counselling services, and flexible teaching and learning strategy are suggested to enhance students' academic integration and self-efficacy.},

  abstract = {The introductory programming course is difficult for many university students, especially students who have little prior exposure to programming. Many factors affecting student success have been identified, but there is still a dearth of knowledge about how key factors combine to affect course outcomes. In this study we develop and empirically test a model integrating three factors of importance in learning to program: previous programming experience, perceived self-efficacy, and knowledge organization. The participants were non-majors. The findings showed that perceived self-efficacy increased significantly during a semester course. Previous experience affected perceived self-efficacy but not knowledge organization. Both perceived self-efficacy and knowledge organization had an effect on the course grade, as well as on success in a specific programming task, debugging. The results on self-efficacy also suggested that the participants were overconfident about their programming capabilities. The contribution of this paper is the identification of the joint effects of an important set of factors for programming success by non-majors.},

While career and elective STEM courses had significantly higher success rates face-to-face than liberal arts and major requirement STEM courses respectively, career STEM courses had significantly higher success rates online than would be expected, while elective STEM courses had significantly lower success rates online than would be expected given the face-to-face results. Once propensity score matching was used to generate a matched subsample which was balanced on a number of student characteristics, differences in course outcomes by course characteristics were no longer significant. This suggests that while certain types of STEM courses can be identified as higher or lower risk in the online environment, this appears not to be because of the courses themselves, but rather because of the particular characteristics of the students who choose to take these courses online. Findings suggests that one potential intervention for improving online STEM course outcomes could be to target students in specific courses which are at higher risk in the online environment; this may allow institutions to leverage interventions by focusing them on the STEM courses at greatest risk of lower online success rates, where the students who are at highest risk of online dropout seem to be concentrated.},

  abstract = {The Lifson-Roig Model (LRM) and all its variants describe the {$\alpha$}-helix to coil transition in terms of additive component-free energies within a free energy decomposition scheme, and these contributions are interpreted through sequence-context dependent nucleation and propagation parameters. Although this phenomenological approach is able to adequately fit experimental data on helix content and heat capacity, the number of required parameters increases dramatically with additional sequence variation. Moreover, due to nonadditive competing microscopic effects that are difficult to disentangle within a LRM, large uncertainties within the parameters emerge. We offer an alternative view that removes the need for sequence-context parameterization by focusing on individual microsopic interactions within a free energy decomposition and explicitly account for nonadditivity in conformational entropy through network rigidity using a Distance Constraint Model (DCM). We apply a LRM and a DCM to previously published experimental heat capacity and helix content data for a series of heterogeneous polypeptides. Both models describe the experimental data well, and the parameters from both models are consistent with prior work. However, the number of DCM parameters is independent of sequence-variability, the parameter values exhibit better transferability, and the helix nucleation is predicted by the DCM explicitly through the nonadditive nature of conformational entropy. The importance of these results is that the DCM offers a system-independent approach for modeling stability within polypeptides and proteins, where the demonstrated accuracy for the {$\alpha$}-helix to coil transition over a series of heterogeneous polypeptides described here is one case in point. \textcopyright{} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This approach provides new peer learning opportunities to the students through challenge formulation, solving, and assessment. We have applied the approach to design course projects for a database course in our data science program with students from diverse academic backgrounds. Results from peer evaluations and surveys indicate that students were generally satisfied with the quality of peer challenges and solutions, and the process of formulating and solving challenges has helped students gain problem design, critical thinking, and data analytics skills.},

New research also shows that believing (or being taught) that social attributes can be developed can lower adolescents' aggression and stress in response to peer victimization or exclusion, and result in enhanced school performance. We conclude by discussing why psychological interventions that change students' mindsets are effective and what educators can do to foster these mindsets and create resilience in educational settings.},

Therefore, this study examined the role of academic emotions (enjoyment, anxiety, and boredom) in the relationship between perceived academic control and self-regulated learning in online learning. The path model was proposed to test the mediating and moderating effects of academic emotions. Data were collected from 426 Korean college students registered in online courses, and a path analysis was conducted. The results demonstrated that enjoyment mediated the relationship between perceived academic control and self-regulated learning, but the moderating effect of enjoyment was not significant. Boredom and anxiety did not have significant mediating effects on self-regulated learning, whereas they showed significant moderating effects in the relationship between perceived academic control and self-regulated learning. The role of academic emotions in learning and their implications for facilitating students' self-regulated learning in online learning were discussed based on the findings.},

SAT scores, on the other hand, can be assumed to have the same meaning across high schools. Our analyses of a large national sample show that, when pooled within-high-school analyses are applied, high school grades and class rank have larger correlations with family income and education than is evident in the results of typical analyses, and SAT scores have smaller associations with socioeconomic factors. SAT scores and high school grades, therefore, have more similar associations with SES than they do when only the usual across-high-school correlations are considered.},
